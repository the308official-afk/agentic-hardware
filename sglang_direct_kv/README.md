# SGLang Direct KV Instrumentation Testbed

## Goal

Build a direct SGLang-based testbed for hint-guided KV cache prefetching.

This project intentionally starts with SGLang rather than fake KV tensors. The goal is to find and instrument the real SGLang KV/cache/offload path, then emulate future hardware support in software.

## What We Are Testing

Agentic workloads naturally create wait windows:

```text
model turn
-> tool call: run tests / search repo / build
-> wait
-> tool returns
-> next model turn
```

During the wait, the runtime often knows:

```text
this session may resume soon
this session has priority
this session's KV should be ready before the next turn
```

The testbed will compare:

```text
Mode 1: no prefetch
Mode 2: generic software prefetch
Mode 3: hint-aware direct KV prefetch/protection
```

## Milestones

### Milestone 0: Testbed Scaffold - Completed

Status: completed locally and uploaded to EC2.

What this proved:

```text
The project has a clean direct-SGLang testbed structure.
The EC2 upload/download/SSH scripts work.
The Python package installs in editable mode.
```

Key files:

```text
scripts/setup_ec2.sh
scripts/run_sglang_server.sh
scripts/run_sglang_hicache_server.sh
scripts/probe_sglang_kv_paths.py
scripts/extract_sglang_kv_targets.py
scripts/run_workload.py
src/agentic_kv/instrumentation.py
```

### Milestone 1: SGLang Internals Map - Completed

Status: completed on EC2.

This milestone was not about performance. It was about finding where SGLang keeps and moves KV cache data.

What we answered:

```text
Where are KV blocks allocated?
Where are prefix/radix cache entries stored?
Where does eviction happen?
Is HiCache or CPU offload available in this install?
Which functions look useful for direct KV instrumentation?
```

Commands used:

```bash
python scripts/probe_sglang_kv_paths.py --out artifacts/sglang_probe.json
python scripts/extract_sglang_kv_targets.py \
  --out-json artifacts/sglang_kv_targets.json \
  --out-md artifacts/sglang_kv_targets.md
```

Result:

```text
SGLang package scanned successfully.
Matched files: 633
Total line hits: 19707
Artifacts written under artifacts/.
```

Important SGLang targets found:

```text
HiCacheController.load()
HiCacheController.write()
HiCacheController.evict_device()
HiCacheController.evict_host()
HiRadixCache
RadixCache
KVCache
MHATokenToKVPool
MHATokenToKVPoolHost
scheduler._prefetch_kvcache()
```

### Milestone 2: Real SGLang + HiCache Smoke Test - Completed

Status: completed on EC2.

This milestone proved that the testbed can run a real model, on a real GPU, with SGLang hierarchical KV cache enabled.

What we proved:

```text
SGLang runs on the EC2 GPU.
Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct loads successfully.
Hierarchical KV cache can be enabled.
SGLang allocates real device KV cache.
SGLang allocates real host HiCache memory.
A real OpenAI-compatible chat request completes.
```

Successful smoke result:

```text
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
response: OK
hierarchical cache: enabled
hicache_size: 14 GB
attention backend: triton
prefill attention backend: triton
decode attention backend: triton
```

Important fixes made during this milestone:

```text
Use Python 3.11 instead of Python 3.9.
Install Python development headers.
Install minimal CUDA 12.8 JIT dependencies.
Auto-export CUDA_HOME when nvcc is available.
Disable CUDA graph and overlap scheduling for smoke tests.
Force Triton attention for prefill and decode.
Lower HiCache host pool from 16 GB to 14 GB on g5.2xlarge.
Prune old Docker state to free disk space.
```

### Milestone 3: Log Real KV Movement - Next

Status: next milestone.

Goal:

```text
Instrument SGLang's real HiCache path and log KV movement events.
```

Events we want to capture:

```text
request/session observed
KV allocated
KV written from GPU HBM to host memory
KV loaded from host memory back to GPU HBM
KV evicted from GPU
KV evicted from host
tokens/pages affected
time spent in each movement
```

Why this matters:

```text
Before we claim prefetch benefits, we need proof that we can observe the real KV movement path.
```

### Milestone 4: Add Direct Hint Hooks

Status: planned.

Goal:

```text
Connect agent/session hints to SGLang KV movement decisions.
```

Example hint:

```text
Agent 42 entered tool_wait.
Expected return: 500 ms.
Priority: high.
Reuse confidence: high.
```

Target behavior:

```text
Mark this session as likely to resume.
Prefer loading its KV before the resume request arrives.
Avoid evicting it immediately after loading.
Record whether the hint helped.
```

### Milestone 5: Compare Three Modes

Status: planned.

Goal:

```text
Run the same agentic workload under three modes.
```

Modes:

```text
Mode 1: no prefetch
Mode 2: generic software prefetch
Mode 3: hint-aware direct KV prefetch/protection
```

Main question:

```text
Does hint-aware KV movement reduce post-tool resume latency compared with no prefetch and generic prefetch?
```

### Milestone 6: Manager Demo Results

Status: planned.

Goal:

```text
Produce a small, credible result table and timeline traces.
```

Outputs:

```text
TTFT after tool return
P50/P95/P99 resume latency
KV load/write/eviction counts
prefetch hit/late/wasted rate
bandwidth or decode interference signal if available
short timeline examples for Agent 42-style workflows
```

## Recommended EC2 Machine

Start with:

```text
g5.2xlarge
1x NVIDIA A10G
24 GB GPU memory
8 vCPUs
32 GiB RAM
```

Use a small model first:

```text
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
```

Avoid 7B models at first because we need memory headroom for KV pressure.

## Setup On EC2

Recommended base image:

```text
AWS Deep Learning AMI GPU PyTorch
```

Then:

```bash
cd agentic_hardware/sglang_direct_kv
bash scripts/setup_ec2.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Verify GPU:

```bash
nvidia-smi
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

Probe SGLang:

```bash
python scripts/probe_sglang_kv_paths.py --out artifacts/sglang_probe.json
python scripts/extract_sglang_kv_targets.py \
  --out-json artifacts/sglang_kv_targets.json \
  --out-md artifacts/sglang_kv_targets.md
```

Start SGLang:

```bash
bash scripts/run_sglang_server.sh Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
```

Start SGLang with hierarchical KV cache enabled:

```bash
bash scripts/run_sglang_hicache_server.sh Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
```

This enables SGLang's host/device KV cache path:

```text
--enable-hierarchical-cache
--hicache-size
--hicache-io-backend
--hicache-mem-layout
--mem-fraction-static
--attention-backend triton
--prefill-attention-backend triton
--decode-attention-backend triton
--disable-cuda-graph
--disable-overlap-schedule
```

The launcher uses the Triton attention backend for prefill and decode, and disables CUDA graph plus overlap scheduling by default. Some SGLang/FlashInfer/TVM paths still JIT compile kernels and require `CUDA_HOME`/`nvcc`, so `setup_ec2.sh` installs the minimal CUDA 12.8 JIT packages on Amazon Linux 2023 by default. Later performance runs can enable CUDA graphs and overlap scheduling again.

For `g5.2xlarge`, the launcher defaults to:

```text
HICACHE_SIZE_GB=14
MEM_FRACTION_STATIC=0.55
```

HiCache currently expects the host KV cache pool to be larger than the device KV cache pool. If this assertion fails, either increase `HICACHE_SIZE_GB` or lower `MEM_FRACTION_STATIC`.

Run workload driver:

```bash
python scripts/run_workload.py --config configs/g5_2xlarge_smoke.yaml --mode no_prefetch
python scripts/run_workload.py --config configs/g5_2xlarge_smoke.yaml --mode generic_prefetch
python scripts/run_workload.py --config configs/g5_2xlarge_smoke.yaml --mode hint_aware
```

## Direct Instrumentation Plan

The direct adapter lives in:

```text
src/agentic_kv/instrumentation.py
```

It exposes the operations we want future hardware to provide:

```text
tag_session_kv(session_id, priority, deadline, confidence)
prefetch_session_kv(session_id)
protect_session_kv(session_id, until_ms)
release_session_kv(session_id)
collect_kv_telemetry()
```

At first, the adapter is probe-only. After the SGLang KV/cache/offload paths are identified, we will replace the no-op methods with real calls into SGLang internals.

## Metrics

Primary:

```text
tool-return-to-first-token latency
time to first token
KV reload/prefetch wait time
P50/P95/P99 resume latency
```

Telemetry:

```text
prefetch submitted
prefetch completed
prefetch hit
prefetch late
prefetch wasted
evicted before use
protected until reuse
decode slowdown
```

## Important Note

This testbed is designed for direct KV instrumentation.

Prefix prewarming may still be useful as a fallback baseline, but it is not the main approach here. The main path is to find SGLang's real KV/cache/offload code and instrument that path directly.
